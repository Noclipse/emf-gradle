# Contributing to Eclipse EMF

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Eclipse EMF is a modeling framework and code generation facility for building
tools and other applications based on a structured data model. From a model
specification described in XMI, EMF provides tools and runtime support to
produce a set of Java classes for the model, a set of adapter classes that
enable viewing and command-based editing of the model, and a basic editor.
Models can be specified using annotated Java, XML documents, or modeling tools
like Rational Rose, then imported into EMF. Most important of all, EMF provides
the foundation for interoperability with other EMF-based tools and applications.

Eclipse XSD is a library that provides an API for manipulating the components of
an XML Schema as described by the W3C XML Schema specifications, as well as an
API for manipulating the DOM-accessible representation of XML.
